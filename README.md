# SC2002 Fastfood-Ordering-And-Management-System
Our group was tasked to design a fast food ordering and management system to facilitate ordering of food, management of orders, management of staffs across branches for a fast food brand. On top of that, the system also requires us to allow admin to conduct administrative activities. We made use of the SOLID principle to design the system and we passed several test cases. 

Additionally, we integrated classes to facilitate the system to read data from excel sheets, reduced the need of entering the data manually into the system.
